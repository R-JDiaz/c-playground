OMP SCHEDULING 

static - assigns a specific(evenly) iteration in each thread before execution(loop)
dynamic - can be used as a loadbalancer, gives more on fast threads
auto - lets the compiler choose what's best sched type to run
guided - loads in large chunk sizes and decreases exponentially
runtime - the sched type are assigned depending on the inputs(code)
