-private(var)

-shared(var)
    -default, all threads shares the var
-collapse(n of loops)
    -this lets the inner run in threading
    -default of for is the outermost loop only in parallel but the inner are not
-if(condition)
    -run in parallel if condition is true else sequentially
-num_threads(n)
    -declares the number of threads explicitly
-default(none) private(*vars) shared(*vars)
    -none forces you to declare the  attibutes if the variables explicitly
-for *clauses
    -combinations of the clauesse above
